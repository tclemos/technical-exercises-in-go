# Merge Sort

> In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.[2] A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort appeared in a report by Goldstine and von Neumann as early as 1948.

## Constraints
- The input must have at least 2 numbers.
- The collection can have repeated numbers.
- You must use a merge sort algorithm.

## Example 1: 
> Given nums = [8, 7, 1, 2, 4],
> 
> return [1, 2, 4, 7, 8].

## Example 2:
> Given nums = [1, 2, 3, 4],
> 
> return [1, 2, 3, 4].

# Usage
All the numbers should be provided via command line arguments.
