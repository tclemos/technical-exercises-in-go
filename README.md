# Technical exercises in Go

Since I just discovered the Go Lang in early 2019 and started studying this topic, I decided to create this repository to help me tracking my evolution progress with Go and also to have the ability to share with friends the content I will be exploring during this journey.

_- Would you like to help me in this journey?_

Feel free to take advantage of or suggest some improvements in any code found here in this repository, it will be a pleasure to help and I really appreciate your help.

Since we have aligned the purpose, I'm assuming that we are good to ___Go___! \ʕ◔ϖ◔ʔ/

Let's ___Go___?
