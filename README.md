# Technical exercises in Go

Since I just discovered the Go Lang in early 2019 and started studying this topic, I decided to create this repository to help me track my evolution progress with Go and also to have the ability to share with friends the content I will be exploring during this journey.

_- Hey Thiago, can I help you out on this journey???_

__- Sure__! 

Feel free to take advantage from; or to suggest some improvements to any code from this repository. 

It will be my pleasure to help you and I would really appreciate your help.

That said, I'm assuming that we are good to ___Go___!

Shall we ___Go___?
